      content="Phoenix is a conversational assistant designed to feel more human, more intuitive, and simply easier to talk to than most AI systems out there.

It’s built around a simple idea: people shouldn’t have to adjust the way they speak just to get help from a machine. Whether you’re typing in full sentences or just tossing out quick thoughts, Phoenix picks up on what you mean — and responds in a way that feels natural, thoughtful, and useful.

You won’t get robotic phrases or copy-paste-style replies here. Instead, Phoenix offers clear answers that are actually helpful, whether you’re asking something simple, curious about a topic, or need help breaking down something more complex.

And more than just the information itself, it’s about how that information comes across. Phoenix is confident without being rigid, smart without being overly technical, and straightforward without losing the human tone. It's made to feel like you're getting help from someone who knows their stuff — without making things harder than they need to be.

So whether you're here to learn, clarify, double-check, or just explore ideas, Phoenix is built to support that flow — one easy, human conversation at a time."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
